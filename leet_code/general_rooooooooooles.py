set(nums_list) --> unique items 


using min and max heap is nre efficient than sorting 
by default it's min heap and used as follows:
        import heapq
        heapq.heappush(nums_list,i) .....
        heapq.heappop(nums_list) ......
        ::: the result ---> heap that first item is the min , and when using pop , you pop this min and so on 
        
        # using max heap : use negative input to push  :
                   heapq.heappush(max_heap,-input)
                   -heapq.heappOP(max_heap)
                   
                   
        # : use negative input too to  search : ...if points_info[key]==-input:....

        #remove (pop) len(nums)-k element ---> we will end with having least k elements
